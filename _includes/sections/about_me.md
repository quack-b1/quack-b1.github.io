## About Me
I am a first-year BSc Computer Science student at Gisma University of Applied Sciences in Berlin, Germany. Iâ€™m passionate about technology, leadership, and creating real-world impact through innovation.

I founded **Egypt National Model United Nations (ENMUN)** to empower youth and drive meaningful change. In tech, I'm focused on Python development, cybersecurity, and building projects that bridge ideas and action. I'm currently working toward certifications like Harvard's CS50 and TU Delft's numerous mathematical courses.
